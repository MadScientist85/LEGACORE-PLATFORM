### Route Pattern
```typescript
export const GET = withErrorHandler(async (req: Request) => {

  const { limit, skip } = parsePagination(url)
  
  // Database query with error handling
  const [data, total] = await Promise.all([...])
  
  // Consistent response format
  return NextResponse.json({ data, pagination: {...} })
})
```

## Database Schema Highlights

### Multi-Tenancy
- All models include `companyId` for data isolation
- Companies can be filtered and managed independently
- Each company has its own users, cases, documents, etc.

### Key Relationships
```
Company (1) ──→ (N) Users
Company (1) ──→ (N) Cases
Company (1) ──→ (N) Documents
Company (1) ──→ (1) Credits ──→ (N) CreditTransactions
Company (1) ──→ (N) Projects
Company (1) ──→ (N) Analytics
```

### Enum Types
- `UserRole`: ADMIN, USER, MANAGER, AGENT
- `CaseStatus`: OPEN, IN_PROGRESS, PENDING, CLOSED, ARCHIVED
- `DocumentType`: CONTRACT, INVOICE, REPORT, PROPOSAL, CORRESPONDENCE, OTHER
- `CreditTransactionType`: PURCHASE, USAGE, REFUND, BONUS

## Package Scripts

### Database Management
```bash
npm run prisma:generate    # Generate Prisma client
npm run prisma:migrate     # Run database migrations
npm run prisma:seed        # Seed demo data
npm run prisma:studio      # Open database GUI
npm run db:setup           # Complete setup (all above)
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev                # Start dev server
npm run build              # Build for production
npm run lint               # Run linter
npm run type-check         # TypeScript check
```
